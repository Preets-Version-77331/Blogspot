To create a flow diagram for the provided files, I will describe the flow and interactions between the different components in text form:

### Flow Diagram Description

1. **Frontend (React + Vite)**
   - **index.html**: The main HTML file that includes the root div and the script to load the React application.
   - **src/main.jsx**: The entry point for the React application that renders the `App` component.
   - **src/App.jsx**: The main application component that sets up routing and provides the Blog context.
     - **Navbar/Navigation**: Component for navigation.
     - **Components**:
       - `Home`: Displays the list of blogs.
       - `CreateBlog`: Form to create a new blog.
       - `BlogDetails`: Displays details of a specific blog.
   - **package.json**: Lists dependencies, scripts, and project metadata.
   - **index.css**: Main CSS file using TailwindCSS for styling.
   - **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, such as logs and node_modules.

2. **Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)**
   - **app.js**: The main entry point for the backend application.
     - **Middleware**:
       - `bodyParser`: Parses incoming request bodies.
       - `cors`: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
       - `express.json()`: Parses JSON payloads.
     - **Routes**:
       - `/api`: Handles all blog-related routes via `blogRouter`.
       - `errorController.get404`: Handles 404 errors.
     - **Database Connection**: Connects to MongoDB using credentials from environment variables.
   - **Controllers**:
     - **blogController.js**: Handles CRUD operations for blogs (get, post, delete, like, unlike, comment).
     - **errorController.js**: Handles 404 errors.
   - **Models**:
     - **Blog.js**: Defines the schema for blog posts in MongoDB.
   - **.env.example**: Provides an example environment configuration file for MongoDB database credentials.
   - **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, such as environment files and log files.
   - **learningNotes.txt**: Contains notes on singleton pattern and hardcoded values in constructors.

This textual flow diagram describes how the frontend and backend components interact in the Blogspot repository. Each file and its role in the overall architecture are detailed.

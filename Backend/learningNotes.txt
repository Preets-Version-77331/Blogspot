1). Generally to constructor me hum  values  expect jerte hai but yhana pe ye  constructor hardcord kyu hai ? 

Ans:-

In the given code, the constructor in the ExchangeRateService class is not expecting values because it is designed as a singleton pattern. Here's why:

Singleton Pattern
The singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the class is created throughout the application. By exporting a single object (new ExchangeRateService()), the same instance is shared across all modules that import it.

Why Hardcoded Values in the Constructor?
Configuration Values:

The apiKey and baseURL are constants for this service. These are not meant to be changed dynamically when the class is instantiated. Instead, they are pre-configured as part of the class setup.
apiKey is fetched from the environment variables (process.env.EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY) to ensure security and flexibility.
Avoiding Dependency Injection in Constructor:

If these values were passed as arguments to the constructor, every module that uses ExchangeRateService would have to pass these values explicitly.
Hardcoding them in the constructor makes the class self-contained and easier to use without external dependencies.
Singleton Design Choice:

Since the class is instantiated only once, these values are initialized when the object is created. No external input is required because the configuration is fixed.
Example Without Hardcoding
If the design required flexibility, you could modify the class to accept these values in the constructor. Here's how that would look:

javascript
Copy code
class ExchangeRateService {
    constructor(apiKey, baseURL) {
        this.rates = null;
        this.apiKey = apiKey;
        this.baseURL = baseURL;
    }
    async getRates() {
        const url = `${this.baseURL}${this.apiKey}/latest/INR`;
        console.log('fetching rates from :-', url);
        const response = await axios.get(url);
        if (response.status === 200 && response.data.result === 'success') {
            this.rates = response.data.conversion_rates;
        }
    }

    convert(amount, sourceCurrency, targetCurrency) {
        const sourceRate = this.rates[sourceCurrency];
        const targetRate = this.rates[targetCurrency];
        return amount * (targetRate / sourceRate);
    }
}

// Example usage:
const service = new ExchangeRateService(process.env.EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY, 'https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/');
module.exports = service;
However, this approach would break the simplicity of the singleton pattern and require more setup wherever the class is used.

Why Current Design is Effective
The current design:

Simplifies usage by encapsulating the setup inside the class.
Leverages the singleton pattern effectively to ensure a single instance of ExchangeRateService with pre-configured values.
Provides clear separation of concerns: the service fetches rates and performs conversions without requiring input for setup on every use.
